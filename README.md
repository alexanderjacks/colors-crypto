- [Fork this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
- [clone to your local machine](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
- ```cd colors-crypto/```
- ```npm i && yarn start```
 - _In a new Terminal_
 ```sass --watch src/App.scss:src/App.css```

You now have the Sass compiler running, and Bootstrap, Bourbon and Saffron all set to leverage in a React/Webpack/React-Router boilerplate. Enjoy.
